# Quick Video Screenshot

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/quick-video-screenshot/"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/585534/107280546-7b9b2a00-6a26-11eb-8f9f-f95932f4bfec.png" alt="Get Letterboxd Extras for Firefox"></a>

A permission-less add-on that allows for quick downloading of screenshots of videos from (theoretically) any website! Unlike other similar add-ons, this does not require any site permissions and instead can only access a website when you click the add-on action button to take a screenshot.

The benefit of a permission-less add-on is that you can be sure the add-on isn't stealing any data - not to say that other add-ons are unsafe in any way.

Because I made this primarily for my own use, I have not tested this against many websites. It should work for any website, but I have only tested with Youtube and Plex.
